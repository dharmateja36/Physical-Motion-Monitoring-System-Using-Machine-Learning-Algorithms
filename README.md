## Introduction
In recent times, human activity recognition has gained significant importance in various domains, particularly in health and security. The ability to track and understand human activities has immense potential, enabling personalized assistance and relevant recommendations. Moreover, it plays a vital role in surveillance applications, promptly detecting suspicious behavior for enhanced security. Additionally, human activity recognition empowers individuals with disabilities, facilitating greater independence and improved access to services. Our project aims to develop an advanced system utilizing the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) dataset and advanced machine learning algorithms. By leveraging this dataset and employing state-of-the-art ML techniques, we seek to create a robust system capable of accurately recognizing and classifying diverse human activities with high precision and efficiency.
## System Architecture
A comprehensive system architecture is proposed for physical motion detection, with a focus on Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using a dataset from the UCI Repository. The project follows a systematic approach encompassing multiple crucial stages. Initially, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics, distribution, and patterns. Data cleaning is then executed to remove duplicates, handle outliers, and address noisy data, ensuring a representative and reliable dataset. Data transformation techniques, including integration and scaling, are applied to enable comprehensive analysis. In the subsequent stage, data models for HAR are developed using various classification algorithms, such as KNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and SVC. To evaluate model performance, common assessment metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy, and support are utilized, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the system's efficiency in recognizing and classifying human activities based on physical motion patterns.

## Data Preprocessing
During our analysis of the datasets, we diligently addressed the issue of duplicate records to maintain data integrity and prevent redundancy. Careful examination and comparison of entries led to the identification and systematic removal of duplicate records, resulting in a dataset free from redundancy. Additionally, we identified the presence of outliers in the dataset, which significantly deviate from the majority of observations. To ensure robust and reliable analysis, we employed a common technique of replacing outliers with upper and lower bounds, preserving the overall data distribution while minimizing the impact of extreme values. These steps were crucial in maintaining data quality and ensuring the accuracy of subsequent analyses and modeling.
## Data Transformation
To consolidate the data from various activity-type datasets, we performed data integration by combining them into a single dataset. This involved adding a new column named "Activity" as a label or identifier for each activity type, ensuring consistency and compatibility among the datasets. After merging the dataset, we proceeded with data scaling using the StandardScaler technique to standardize numerical features, removing the influence of varying scales across different features. By applying the StandardScaler, we rescaled the data to have a standard deviation of 1 and a mean of 0, bringing all features to a similar scale and eliminating potential bias from original measurement units. Subsequently, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed.
## Dimensionality Reduction
After data transformation, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed to identify significant trends and correlations in the dataset to enhance the accuracy of model forecasts. PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that creates new independent variables (principal components) from the data. The dataset was initially normalized by eliminating the mean and scaling each feature to have unit variance, ensuring equal contribution from all features. A correlation matrix was produced to determine attribute correlations, as illustrated. PCA was then applied to compute eigenvectors and eigenvalues, capturing significant data variation. The transformed data yielded a reduced dimensionality space using the principal components. A cumulative variance plot was generated to determine the optimal number of primary components for further analysis, revealing that seven factors accounted for over 95% of the variance. Subsequently, the data's dimensionality was reduced to 7 principal components with 22097 rows, effectively preserving essential information for predicting the target variable while capturing the majority of data variability.
## Data Splitting and Sampling
Data preparation is a crucial aspect of data modeling projects, involving tasks like data cleansing, transformation, and PCA. In this project, 8 datasets were collected, each representing different human activities such as walking and running, containing accelerometer and gyrometer measurements. To anticipate human actions using machine learning models, the datasets were divided into training and testing subsets, with an 80:20 ratio. The training set was used to teach the models patterns and correlations between measurements and human actions, while the testing set evaluated the models' generalization potential by assessing their performance on unseen data. This splitting strategy allowed for accurate evaluation of model performance using a separate testing set. The sizes of each set were as shown in the project.
## Modeling
For the project implementation, various ML models were selected, including KNN, Linear SVM, RBF SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, based on their potential to predict human activity using the collected accelerometer and gyrometer data. Each model offers unique characteristics and capabilities, allowing the project to explore different approaches and identify the most effective method for human activity recognition. KNN is a non-parametric approach that classifies new data points based on similarities with training data. Linear SVM finds an optimal hyperplane to separate activity classes, while RBF SVM captures non-linear relationships for complex pattern recognition. Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that handles high-dimensional data and imbalanced datasets, providing accurate predictions and feature importance measures. Decision Tree, known for interpretability, handles numerical and categorical data, making it valuable for classifying and predicting human activities and gaining insights into influential features and decision rules. The implementation of these models aims to advance the field of human activity recognition and achieve high accuracy rates.
## Evaluation Results
The project involved testing different models on a test dataset using techniques like Normal sampling, Smote sampling, and hyperparameter tuning. Among all the models tested, Random Forest consistently outperformed the others in all the test runs, achieving the highest accuracy rate of 87.69%. The KNN model closely followed with an accuracy rate of 87.06%, while the RBF SVM and Decision Tree models obtained accuracy rates of 84.77% and 83.12% respectively. However, the Linear SVM model demonstrated a relatively lower accuracy rate of 59.93%. Certain activities like Sitting, Jogging, Swimming, and Cycling showed higher accuracy rates compared to others, while activities like Walking Downstairs, Walking Upstairs, and Pushups obtained lower accuracy due to limited data samples in the training dataset.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the project on human activity recognition highlighted that the Random Forest (RF) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models excelled in terms of accuracy compared to other models. The Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) model faced challenges in achieving high accuracy, primarily due to limited data for certain activities, despite using sampling techniques to address data imbalance. Activities like sitting, walking, cycling, and swimming showed higher accuracies, benefiting from sufficient and balanced data. Notably, sitting consistently achieved the highest accuracy rate of nearly 98% across all models. To enhance predictions for activities with limited data, future efforts should focus on gathering more samples to create a balanced dataset. Exploring alternative techniques or algorithms could also help address imbalanced data challenges and improve accuracy rates for all activities. Overall, the RF and KNN models demonstrated their effectiveness in accurately predicting human activities, providing valuable insights for further research and the application of machine learning techniques in the field of human activity recognition.
## Limitations
This project on human activity recognition has shown promising results, but it is essential to acknowledge its limitations. A significant limitation is the presence of data imbalance, especially for activities like Jogging, Pushups, Walking downstairs, and Walking upstairs. Despite applying techniques like Smote sampling and random sampling to address this issue, the imbalanced data distribution persisted, impacting the accuracy rates for these activities. To overcome this limitation, a more balanced representation of data is needed to enhance the models' performance in recognizing and predicting these specific activities. Another limitation relates to the potential sensitivity of the models to sensor placement. Variations in sensor placement or how individuals wear the sensors can introduce discrepancies that may affect the models' accuracy. Hence, it is crucial to carefully consider and standardize sensor placement protocols to ensure reliable and consistent results across different participants and scenarios.
