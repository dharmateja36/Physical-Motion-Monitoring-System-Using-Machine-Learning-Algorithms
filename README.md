# Physical-Motion-Monitoring-System-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
This project is to determine the motion of the human interaction based on Machine Learning Algorithms

1) Datasets have been added in this folder in which each file has been merged and assigned the activity column using Pandas for modeling. These datasets contain the values taken from gyrometer and accelerometer for each activity such as Swimming, Walking, Sitting, and so on.

2) All this datasets were merged into single unified dataset and then data cleaning techniques were applied on that unified dataset. Then exploratory data analysis was performed on this dataset to understand the patterns among the data.

3) Then PCA and Scaling techniques were applied on this dataset before going for modeling.

4) Once the dataset is splitted into 80:20 ratio for training and testing, modeling was performed on the data by considering the random sampling and then SMOTE sampling was considered. After observing both samplings, it is evident that random sampling performed better than SMOTE sampling.
